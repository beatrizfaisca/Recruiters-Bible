# Recruiting Resources 101

Olá! It means "hello" in Portuguese, my native language. 👋🏼

Welcome to Recruiting Resources 101, a place where you will be able to find several tools and suggestions to make recruitment easier. 

I'm a technical recruiter and have helped many tech companies in scaling up their teams when it comes to Engineering, Product, Data Science and Customer Success. 

If you stumbled across this repository you are most like in the Talent Acquisition world yourself, so feel free to reach out to me with any additional suggestions. 

PS: Although my focus is technical recruitment, here you can find tools, websites, blogs, videos and training materials that apply to any area of specialisation. 🔎
